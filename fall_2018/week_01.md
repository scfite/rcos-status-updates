## Last Week's Accomplishments

I also talked to several team members about how to divide up thework for designing the website.

## This Week's Plan

I plan on working with my team member Andrew to make a wireframe for the website and begin work on the website itself.

## Anything Blocking?


The only thing that is slowing me down is my lack of experience with web development which is to be expected becuase I am doing this project to gain full-stack experience

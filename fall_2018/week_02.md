## Last Week's Accomplishments

Began work on the wireframe with my partner who I am designing the website with. I got some exposure to HTML and how websites are structured. I added to the readme section which explains how to install and setup django. I added steps  explaining the python setup for people who are using Ubuntu.

## This Week's Plan

I plan on having a working outline of the website by next friday. This will require becomming familliar with bootstrap and django. 
## Anything Blocking?

My lack of experience with web development. Also trying to communicate efficiently is more challenging than I thought it would be.

## Last Week's Accomplishments

Could not do much work because of test. Watched some tutoritals on web dev via django.

## This Week's Plan

I have a lot more tests this week but I hope to actually create a webpage and play around with the design.


## Anything Blocking?

Lack of time due to schoolwork.

## Notes

The hardest part of this project for me is setting aside time to work on the website because there are no firm due dates like my other classes.

## Last Week's Accomplishments

I did not do much work last week because of all of my tests. I watched some youtube tutorials on web development.

## This Week's Plan

I have to study for a lot of tests but I plan to get as much code down as possible so I can get feedback on what I am doing. I also want to get my local branch merged with the master remote so I can become familiar with the process before I make too many changes which will make it harder.


## Anything Blocking?

The hardest thing for me is learning web development. I don't have any experience with web development so learning Django on top of that makes it a little more confusing. I think that it would have been better for me to already be familiar with HTML and the basics of web dev before learning django.

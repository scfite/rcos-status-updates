## Last Week's Accomplishments

I did not do any work over thanksgiving break because I didn't really have an internet connection.

## This Week's Plan

I have more tests coming up but towards the end of the week I plan on spending a full afternoon watching tutorials and getting as much code down as I can. 

## Anything Blocking?

One thing blocking me is that I don't know the best resources to learn how to make a well designed bootstrap webpage. I think it's because of my lack of experience and knowledge. I lack fundementals so when I see a lot of tutorials I don't know what I am writing down and am just copying lines of code.

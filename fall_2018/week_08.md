## Last Week's Accomplishments

Ran into a Django bug when trying to make another 'app' within django. Spent a good amount of time trying to fix it but had little progress.

## This Week's Plan

This week I plan on rewalking through the tutorial series that helped me get to where I am now. Since I don't have much code written I might redo the app/page that I made.

## Anything Blocking?

I ran into a Django bug called 'Template does not exist' which seems to be a very common beginners bug based on my stack overflow reading. I feel that I don't understand templates well enough to know where in the process of making the app that I messed up. I think that I will just redo the page/app by following the youtube tutorial that has gotten me to where I am now.

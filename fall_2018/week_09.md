## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week I got down as much code as I could. Last week was more about me learning HTML and CSS while not taking advantage of the Djjango framework to its fullest. I tried to structure every as best I could using "jinja" logic to where when the next person comes along to work on the search page they can just delete the current dummy header file in the jinja includes statement and replace it with the name of the one they have chosen. 

## This Week's Plan

I do plan on learning more HTML and CSS becauase it was somewhat interesting. While I like the nature of backend more I think that it would do me service to know more HTML and CSS. Django will  be the framework that I learn with and become most comfortable with because it seems to be very popular at the moment. Next semester I am not sure which project I will be working on but I am definitley still open to working on petitions, hiopefully the next semester will have a smoother flow to it because I will have already been aquainted with the codebase and will have so much more experience with web dev.

## Anything Blocking?


## Notes

I felt that this semesters pacing was off for me because I was so intimidated at the beginning that I was afraid to push any code that wasn't perfect, but I am glad that by the end I became more comfortable with learning HTML on a public project like this.

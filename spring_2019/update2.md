## Last Week's Accomplishments
This past week has been busy for me, but I was able to comment a good 
ammount of the code that I didn't understand fully. I started working
on setting up a testing system that can replicate my input and enforce 
the required specs on my output. Last week I also met with the project
lead to talk about how we are going to connect all of the components
and was able to understand how the search engine works better.

## This Week's Plan
This week I plan on finalizing the testing and commenting and hopefully
will be finished with this component by this time next week. I then 
should be able to start work on another component of the search engine. 

## Aything Blocking?
Nope.

## Last Week's Accomplishments
I was busy this last week but I was able to successfly get my component
linked with the link analysis team. I have been able to receive data from
the craling team for a while, but this past week was the first time that
we were able to send data from my component to the link analyis team. The 
data isn't formatted correctly however. 

## This Week's Plan
This week I need to format the data that I am sending Link Analysis correctly.
I also need to make sure that I am collecting the appropriate data because I
have not tested the output with non test files. 

## Aything Blocking?
Nope.

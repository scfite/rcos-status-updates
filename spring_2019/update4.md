## Last Week's Accomplishments
Last week I was busy so was not able to get as much work done as I would like.
However, I worked with the team lead on linking up my component 
(text transformation) with the crawling component. This didn't involve writing
much code. We mainly had to try and understand how the crawling component works
and how to get it running. We had to do some minor tweaks to my component
because the people who were working on my component before were sending the
wrong data to link analysis.

## This Week's Plan
This upcoming week I plan on formatting my output data correctly. We discovered
that I was sending the wrong data and also was not gathering some info that the
component was intended to.

## Anything Blocking?
Nope.

## Last Week's Accomplishments
Last week, Cameron and I were able to get the loop of Text Transformation, Link
Analysis, and Crawler up and running. These three components are the major back
end loop that scrapes the web and handles the links. Now, as Cameron works to
optimize that loop, I will start to get familiar with the other loop of
Indexing, and Ranking. 

## This Week's Plan
This week I plan on becoming familiar with the other loop of the Indexing and
Ranking components. I hope to have them up and running by the end of next week.

## Anything Blocking?
Nope.

## Last Week's Accomplishments
This week I was not able to accomplish much due to the large amount of work that
I have had (opsys project). I was able to read over the Indexing and Ranking
components. I am still a good ways away from fully understanding how they work
to the point that I will be able to know how to address the issues/bugs that
arise from them.

## This Week's Plan
This week I plan on becoming more familiar with the Indexing and Ranking
components

## Anything Blocking?
Nope

## Last Week's Accomplishments
    This past week Cameron and I worked on getting the Indexing module up and running. We
    accomplished a lot this past week. Achievements include: getting the indexing datbase
    up and running correctly, formatting the data being sent to and from indexing,
    modifying how we parse urls and tightening our requirements for valid url, and
    improving the code in general to be easier to pick up as a new developer.

## This Week's Plan
    Since we have a large portion of the search engine up and running, moving forward our
    plan should be to improve upon the search engine. There is much work to be done there.
    We just found a problem with the indexing component's database where not all links
    that we think should be added are actually added. This next week we plan to work on
    hunting down the bug thats causing it.

## Anything Blocking?
    Nope

## Notes
    Since we have so many components that depend on eachother, it is much easier work on
    the search engine on one machine. This will probably cause me to not have many commits
    even though I have contributed to the code a fair amount. Often times Cam (my partner)
    and I partner code where we will switch who is at the keyboard based on what component
    we are working on or if one person is more familiar with the problem we are dealing
    with.

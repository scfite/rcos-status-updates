## Last Week's Accomplishments
    Last week was fairly busy with exams. However, Cam and I were able to continue 
    documenting the code. We are trying to make every component as usable as possible
    for the next people who pick up the project.

## This Week's Plan
    This week we plan on continuing documentation

## Anything Blocking?
    Nope

## Notes

    A lot of the work I have done has been work that is not able to be commited to
    github. We are often working on the project together or the work that I will be
    doing is part of debugging or getting the components up and running properly. We
    have in practice been keeping the master version of the project on Camerons
    computer because everything is so interdependent.

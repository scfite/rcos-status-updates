## Last Week's Accomplishments
  This past week was very busy. Cam and I did not get much work done on the
  project. However, I was able to fully document the code so that the project
  will require less time to become familiar with it. This will be my first and
  only commit of the semester because most of the code that I wrote was for
  testing machine to machine connection of the search engine or was on Cameron's
  computer.  

## This Week's Plan
  This is the last week of school!!

## Anything Blocking?
  No

## Notes
  I learned a lot this semester about how search engines work as well as how
  webpages interact with search engines. I hope that the work that I put into
  this project with Cameron is not overlooked due to the lack of code commits I
  have.
